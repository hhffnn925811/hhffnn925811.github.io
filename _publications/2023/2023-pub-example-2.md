  With the rise of flexible employment models, more young people are choosing to have multiple careers, multiple identities, and pursue diverse lifestyles, becoming known as "slash youth." However, when slash youth become overly engaged in side jobs, it may hinder the progress and performance of their primary jobs.
  Based on the Conservation of Resources Theory, this study proposes that compulsive passion for side jobs induces role conflict, thereby increasing employees' turnover intention in their primary jobs. Additionally, two moderating variables are introduced to explore the boundary conditions of this relationship: organizational support and family support negatively moderate the relationship between compulsive passion for side jobs and role conflict, as well as the indirect effect of compulsive passion for side jobs on turnover intention in the primary job through role conflict.
  Based on sample data from 203 multi-job workers, this study employs hierarchical regression analysis to test the proposed moderated mediation model, which is supported by the data. These findings provide valuable insights for reducing the turnover intention of slash youth in their primary jobs.
